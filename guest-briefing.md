# UK Genesis Podcast - Guest Briefing

Hi!

Thank you for agreeing to be a guest on the UK Genesis podcast. Here is what we now need from you, and some information for you about the show itself. Please read all of it!

## As Soon As Your Receive This Document

So we can prepare the podcast entry on the ukgenesis.co.uk, we require some information from you.

### Introduction

Write in third person (i.e. “Gary has …” ) an introduction about yourself that will go on to the podcast webpage. A couple of paragraphs about who you are including things like what you do, who you tend to do it for, how long you’ve been doing it, where you are based, your trading name, what your areas of interests are, how long you’ve used Genesis and WordPress etc. Separately, give some URLs that can be used to link up relevant parts of your content. See the latest entries on http://ukgenesis.co.uk/podcasts/ for the typical format.

### Topics

Provide some bullet points of topics you have an interest in talking about. We’ll generally cover the basics about business and workflow (see below for a link to the questions we use), so no need to include those. You can mention these in your introduction if you wish, but this list is generally to prompt the Hosts (though we may include it at the bottom of the introduction). If you’ve got a new product in the pipeline / recently launched, let us know and we can give that some airtime too.

### Photo

We need a photo (typically a headshot) of exactly 960 ⨉ 540px in size. This is used as the podcast featured image, and for bringing attention to some tweets announcing the podcast.

Please send all of this info to Gary as soon as possible.

## Pre-Show

About 30 minutes before the show starts, we’ll send you a link to join the Hangout On Air. In this time, we can test that your microphone is all working, lighting is fine, and so on.

### Lower Third

Once the Hangout is open and you can see and hear us, you should install the Hangout Toolbox app from the left-hand sidebar that appears when you hover over the video feed. It looks like a little red toolbox. If you can’t see it, then find it under More Apps. Once installed, select it, and the right sidebar will show it. Switch to the first tab (person silhouette in a circle) and set your Lower Third - name in first row, contact details in second row, and then turn it on. Any subsequent changes requires you to turn it off and back on again (!). If the content of a line is too long, it will wrap around to the next line (off-screen), so try to use fewer characters. If the lower third (and your image) is backwards, then fix it with the Mirror Image button right next to the Lower Third on/off button.

### Background Apps

Please turn off Dropbox, Skype, and any other apps or devices that may be using up bandwidth, CPU or RAM.

Feel free to tweet the link to the ukgenesis.co.uk/podcasts/… URL at any point.

## Show

At the start time (usually 2pm UK time), we’ll hit the button and start broadcasting. The recorded show lasts about an hour. During this time, we’ll ask you some questions about Genesis and your business. Your answers may lead what the next question will be, but we fallback to the questions in https://github.com/UKGenesis/docs/blob/master/questions.md if needed. It’s up to you whether you want to read this for a heads-up or not. This document also outlines the opening and closing remarks, which are more of a prompt for the hosts.

Feel free to go off on a tangent and turn the topic to what you want to talk about (within reason); this is as much about highlighting you as a person, as it is about highlighting your business.

Don’t worry if we seem distracted - we are listening, but also running the Hangout, checking Twitter for questions or seeing what the next fallback question is!

If you need to mute yourself for any reason, then (on Mac) the keyboard shortcut is CMD-D, or you can use the buttons at the top when you hover over the video feed.

During the show, have the chat sidebar showing (top blue speech bubble icon on left sidebar), and use this if you need to communicate to us privately during the recording. You’ll probably see the hosts talking to each other too.

### On Air
You can tell we’re on broadcasting from the yellow Live indicator in the top right corner. At the end of the show, wait until that indicator has changed back to Off Air before saying something you don’t want recorded!

## Post-Show

After the show has finished, we can chat for a couple of minutes, and find out what the concurrent viewing figures were (typically 10-15 people watching at the same time).
